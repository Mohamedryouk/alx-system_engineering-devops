# Networking basics #0

This project was the first of two introducing networking concepts. In this project, I answered a few quiz-like questions and wrote a couple bash scripts while learning about the OSI model, LAN and WAN networks, and TCP/UDP data transfer protocols.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. OSI model**
  * [0-OSI_model](./0-OSI_model): Text file answering the following questions:
    - What is the OSI model?
    - How is the OSI model organized?

* **1. Types of network**
  * [1-types_of_network](./1-types_of_network): Text file answering the following questions:
    - What type of network a computer in local is connected to?
    - What type of network could connect an office in one building to another office in a building a few streets away?
    - What network do you use when you browse www.google.com from your smartphone (not connected to the Wifi)?

* **2. MAC and IP address**
  * [2-MAC_and_IP_address](./2-MAC_and_IP_address): Text file answering the following questions:
    - What is a MAC address?
    - What is an IP address?

* **3. UDP and TCP**
  * [3-UDP_and_TCP](./3-UDP_and_TCP): Text file answering the following questions:
    - Which statement is correct for the TCP box?
    - Which statement is correct for the UDP box?
    - Which statement is correct for the TCP worker?

* **4. TCP and UDP ports**
  * [4-TCP_and_UDP_ports](./4-TCP_and_UDP_ports): Bash script that displays listening ports.
    - Displays listening sockets.
    - Shows the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs.

* **5. Is the host on the network**
  * [5-is_the_host_on_the_network](./5-is_the_host_on_the_network): Bash script that pings an IP address received as an argument 5 times.
    - Usage: `5-is_the_host_on_the_network {IP_ADDRESS}`
